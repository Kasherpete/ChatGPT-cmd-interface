# Setup:
Within main.py, you will find a piece of code that looks like this:
```python
import openai

# put in your key here

openai.api_key = ""
```
You will need to put in your OpenAI key here. You can access this [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) after
creating your account. The next thing you will need to do is install OpenAI's SDK. All you need to do is run this pip
command:
```
pip install openai
```
After that, you are now able to use ChatGPT from your command line.
